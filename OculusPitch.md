# FPBioimage
## Pitch for Oculus Rift Hardware

FPBioimage is a volumetric rendering app designed to make sharing and publishing 3D scientific data faster and easier. Recently featured in the world-leading journal Nature Photonics (https://www.nature.com/articles/nphoton.2016.273) the original FPBioimage app allows users to interactively view volumetric image data, such as MRI medical data or light sheet microscopy data, in a web browser. With a strong focus on ease-of-use, FPBioimage helps scientists make their data open and accessible to colleagues, collaborators and the wider community.

Since the web app release in 2017, we have developed a suite of plugins and mobile apps to complement FPBioimage. Using universal links, mobile users can visit a website with FPBioimage content on it and open the volumetric data in a dedicated FPBioimage app installed on their device. The native app not only provides better performance than in the mobile browser, but also allows the user to view the 3D data in virtual reality with Google Cardboard.

Users particularly enjoy being immersed in their data with VR, gaining a new perspective and allowing them to identify features not visible otherwise. However running on mobile devices has a number of drawbacks that an Oculus app would overcome. Firstly, framerate can be improved due to the limited graphics capabilities of mobile phones. Secondly, the immersive illusion on Google Cardboard is somewhat broken through control with a gamepad instead of spatially-tracked VR controllers and 6-axis head tracking. Running on an Oculus, users will have access to a cleaner user interface, and can interact with their data more naturally by manipulating it with their hand movements.

The development platform for FPBioimage is Unity, since it allows creation of a full suite of applications from a single development environment. The application already runs in VR on Android and iOS; a port to Oculus would therefore be a fast process, bringing the app to users as soon as mid-2018. Access to Oculus hardware would ensure a high-quality user interface can be purpose-built for the Oculus platform, allowing data to be viewed intuitively with no specialist training.

Future developments of the app will put a focus on medical data, allowing doctors and patients to use the app to view 3D medical scans in VR. This idea lends itself particularly well to the Oculus Go, so that bed-bound patients could easily view their medical data with the mobile VR device brought to them, allowing them to make informed decisions alongside their clinician.

FPBioimage has been created by a single developer, Marcus Fantham, as part of his PhD research at the University of Cambridge.
